**Goal of the Project**
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script


**Steps performed to clean up the data**

1 read train and test data set

2 Merge train and test data sets

3 read features description and activity labels

4 Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

5 assigning column names

6 merge final data set

7 turn activities and subjects into factors

8 create a summary of independent tidy data set from final data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject

10 export and save the summary data set as .txt file
